          <h2>F1 Teams throughout the Years</h2>
          <p>
            As of the Japanese Grand Prix 2023. There have been <b>171</b> constructors who have participated in F1.
            Currently there are only <b>10</b> constructors participating in F1 and it has been the case since 2017.
            The main few that come to mind for even the general public are 
            <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">Ferrari</span>, 
            <span style="color:#00A19B; font-weight: bold;">Mercedes</span>, 
            <span style="color:#ff8000; font-weight: bold;">McLaren</span> 
            as they are well known in the automotive industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Teams have gone through changes in name due to some teams having financial struggles to stay within the sports such as 
            <span style="color:rgb(255, 52, 194); font-weight: bold;">Force India </span> and others have a simple rename due to 
            delegating their operations to a different department in their company like <span style="color:rgb(174, 186, 0); font-weight: bold;">Renault</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            What remains clear though is that <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">Ferrari</span>, 
            <span style="color:#00A19B; font-weight: bold;">Mercedes</span> and
            <span style="color:#0b00a9; font-weight: bold;">Red Bull</span> are the most consistent teams in the top 3 and this is due to their
            financial backing and their ability to attract the best drivers in the world.

          <h2>The Historical Best F1 Teams</h2>
          <p>F1 is a sport that has been around for a long time and has seen many teams come and go. 
            The teams that have been around for a long time have been able to accumulate a lot of points and wins.
            The top 5 teams are 
            <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">Ferrari</span>, 
            <span style="color:#00A19B; font-weight: bold;">Mercedes</span>, 
            <span style="color:#0b00a9; font-weight: bold;">Red Bull</span>, 
            <span style="color:#ff8000; font-weight: bold;">McLaren</span> and 
            <span style="color:#002fff; font-weight: bold;">Williams</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The teams that are not present currently in F1 such as Lotus, Renault, Brabham and Benetton have been bought out by other teams,
            and have been renamed to the current teams that are present in F1. However their iteration of the team has been deemed the most 
            successful due to their dominance in their era of F1.
